                    <h4>3 Days  2 nights Amboseli Serena Lodge Flying Safari Package.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Amboseli Serena Safari Lodge Secluded within a grove of acacia trees, the lodge looks out over the golden savannah plains, with uninterrupted views of the mountain itself. Close by are a series of emerald green swamps, which are fed by the melting snows of Kilimanjaro. These, the only sources of water in this otherwise starkly beautiful but arid park, attract huge numbers of wallowing elephants, hippos, buffalos and plains game. Meanwhile, from the prehistoric site of Observation Hill, the sunset over Kilimanjaro is magnificent.</p>

Both morning and afternoon game drives are offered (with trips to the famous Mzima Springs Hippo Pools and the Shetani Lava Flows). Tsavo offers some of the most magnificent game viewing in the world â€“ vast herds of dust-red elephant, fat pods of hippo, giant crocodile, teeming herds of plains game, a fantasia of bird life and some magical flora. The lush, hippo-inhabited pools of Mzima Springs, fed daily by 250 million litres of water gushing from the lava flows of the Chyulu hills, provide an oasis of green, an under-water hippo-viewing chamber, two nature trails and some unique picnic spots. Sundowners can be taken on safari or at the lodge camp, followed by dinner.</p>
